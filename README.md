# 🚗 Cars Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Cars dataset.

The main purpose of this project is to understand the dataset, clean the data, identify outliers, and explore different patterns using Python and data visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the Cars dataset
- Check columns and data types
- Check missing and duplicate records
- Remove unnecessary columns
- Identify and handle outliers
- Perform basic data analysis
- Create visualizations to understand the data

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about different cars, including:

- Make
- Model
- Year
- Engine HP
- Engine Cylinders
- Transmission Type
- Driven Wheels
- Highway MPG
- City MPG
- MSRP

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 EDA Process

The project includes:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Understanding the dataset
3. Checking columns and data types
4. Checking non-null records
5. Finding unique values
6. Removing duplicate records
7. Removing irrelevant columns
8. Selecting numerical columns
9. Detecting outliers using boxplots
10. Removing outliers using the IQR method
11. Performing data visualization and analysis

## 📈 Outlier Handling

Outliers were identified using boxplots and handled using the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method.

**IQR = Q3 - Q1**

The lower and upper limits were calculated using:

- Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
- Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
